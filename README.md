All the folders will have a README.md file with the course and code to be tested, the files 1_XXXX, 2_XXXX etc... are already created but empty you'll have to copy paste the code manually.

At the end of the course, you can open the folder "assignment_XXX", all the objectives are described in the README.md file, there is, as well, one screenshot with an example in PNG, and the empty xxx.py file for the script.
